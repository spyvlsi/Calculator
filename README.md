# Calculator-Currency-Converter-using-Fixer.io-Api

The application has two activities! The Calculator_Activity and the Converter_Activity! The user can switch between the two screens from a bottom navigation bar, 
and he/she can exit the app by double pressing the back button! 
On the first screen the user has the ability to perform simple mathematical operations sush as addition, substraction,
multiplication and division.
On the second one, the user is able to convert currencies between EURO and other countries, by giving the preferred amount and by selecting the target currency from
a spinner! The base for the conversion is EURO, because the API only supports EURO as base in the free plan!
